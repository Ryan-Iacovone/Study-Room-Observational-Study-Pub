# PUB-Studies
 
## Problem statement: 

The library would like to know how patrons on the top floor are utilizing the four currently available study rooms. The goal is to investigate if the library would benefit from additional study room spaces or if the four currently in use are enough to meet the patron demands. Additionally, if the data illustrates an excess demand for study rooms, itâ€™s important to understand what types of patrons are using the study rooms so that staff can appropriately and informatively make plans for additional study spaces, if so desired. To understand the types of patrons and how they use the study room data will be collected regarding the size of groups requesting study rooms as well as the time-of-day study rooms are requested.  


## Data Set Description:  

In order to investigate the demands for study rooms, library staff tracked study room usage for a nonconcurrent two-week period in November 2022. A tracking sheet was placed at the front desk for librarians to fill out each time a patron came to the desk requesting a study room. The tracking sheet captured four unique variables: date, time of day, size of group, and finally whether a room was available. The data from tracking sheets was then transferred to an excel file where it was uploaded to the program R to perform statistical analyses.
